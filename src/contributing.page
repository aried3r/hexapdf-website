## Contributing

You are welcome to contribute to HexaPDF. Please note that HexaPDF is licensed under the GNU Affero
General Public License version 3 and only code licensed as such can be included.

Before you contribute please sign the [individual contributor license agreement](CLA-I.pdf) or
[entity contributor license agreement](CLA-E.pdf) (for companies and other organizations) and email
the signed document to <t_leitner@gmx.at>. This agreement serves a dual-purpose:

* It provides the basis for a possible relicensing later on, without the trouble of tracking down
  each individual contributor.

* It allows me to keep my options open in regard to commercializing HexaPDF at a later date.
