If you are new to [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), you might wanna have a look at a Ruby tutorial
first, to get acquainted with the language. HexaPDF is 100% Ruby and provides a very idiomatic
interface. So once you know Ruby, you should feel right at home with HexaPDF!

At the [Ruby website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/) you will find all the necessary
materials, whether you are new to programming entirely or you already know a few other languages.
