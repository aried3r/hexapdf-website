This release brings support for [flattening annotations][HexaPDF::Type::Page#flatten_annotations],
i.e. making the appearances of annotations part of the page content itself.

Since AcroForm fields also use annotations for their visual display, this functionality also allows
[flattening of form fields][HexaPDF::Type::AcroForm::Form#flatten]. Form field flattening can now
also be done with the `hexapdf form` CLI command.

Additionally, basic support for the AcroForm signature field was added. However, this does not allow
signing a PDF yet.

There is also a **breaking change** with respect to how annotation appearances are accessed. The
change simplifies getting the correct appearance stream.

As always, have a look at the [changelog] for an overview of all changes.
